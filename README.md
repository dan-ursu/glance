# Glance

Android app that displays time and notifications automatically when taking your phone out of your pocket.

## Don't most phones already have this feature?

Glance is an old Android app I wrote a long time ago, around the time of Android 4.4. It was designed to add a very specific feature that most phones were lacking at the time, but Nokia's Lumia brand of Windows phones had. When the screen is off, if you took your phone out of your pocket, it would automatically show the time and a list of notifications on screen for a few seconds, without having to press the power button. The same effect would also be visible when waving your hand over your phone with the screen off.

I eventually abandoned the project and delisted it from the Google Play store, as every new Android release would slightly break the app in some way or another. (Sincere apologies to anyone whose device it caused more serious issues on!) Moreover, in the meantime, Android has gradually received these or equivalent features.

I have archived the source code of the final version here.

**NOTE: This is a very old project that slowly broke more and more with each new Android release, even causing serious issues with some devices. Compile and run at your own risk.**
